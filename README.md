Regression:

1. Avocado price prediction - Decision tree regressor
    1. Data cleaning
        * No null values
        * No duplicates
    2. Data visualization
        * Each and every columns are correlated
        * There is a positive relation between 'total volume' and all the other columns.
        * All the other columns are also positively correlated with all the columns except the target column.
        * Total volume can go above 3 if the average price is in between 0.5 to 2
        * Average price of 1.0 to 1.6 are high in frequency

Classification

4. Credit card payment classification - KNN
    1. Data cleaning
        * No null values
        * Dropped all duplicates
